Djbdns is installed on your system. Only dnscache can be
started automatically (yet), by initializing the directory with

$ dnscache-conf nobody nobody /usr/local/etc/dnscache 0.0.0.0

and adding the following line to /etc/rc.conf:
dnscache_enable="YES"

Also check the files under /usr/local/etc/dnscache/root/ip/.
